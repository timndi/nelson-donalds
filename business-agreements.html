    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">BUILDING YOUR BUSINESS... IS OUR BUSINESS</h5>
    <h5>Business Agreements</h5> <br>
    <p>
     When business disputes arise, the underlying issues often relate to terms or provisions contained in legal 
     agreements or contracts. One of the best ways to avoid problems later is by ensuring any agreement you enter
      into is both fair and legal.
      <br><br>
      When you work with one of the skilled business agreements attorneys at Samislaw, you can be confident 
      that your agreements are designed to meet your needs while protecting your legal rights in Federal 
      Courts, as well as international tribunals if your business will cross international borders.
      <br><br>

    </p>
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">ASSISTANCE WITH A VARIETY OF CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS</h5>
    <p>
     Our experienced lawyers can help your business with a variety of legal agreements, including business licensing 
     agreements, partnership and joint venture agreements, strategic alliance agreements, financing agreements, 
     non-disclosure agreements, confidentiality agreements, non-compete and non-solicitation agreements, 
     technology-related agreements, and more.
     <br><br>
     Using “boilerplate” or off-the-shelf agreements might save your business money up-front. However, when those 
     agreements aren’t tailored to meet your business’ specific needs and aren’t drafted and reviewed by attorneys
      familiar with the specific laws and regulations that govern your business, you risk facing significant cost,
       hassle, and regulatory scrutiny later.
       <br>    
    </p>
<h5 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">AGREEMENTS FOR YOUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS</h5>
 <p>
    The specific types of agreements your business needs will largely depend on your industry, the 
    products, and services you offer, and how you conduct business.
<br><br>
Sanislaw can help you with business licensing agreements, agreements that will govern strategic business 
relationships such as partnership and joint ventures, contracts to cover the technologies you use and much more.
 </p>
<h5 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND VENDORS</h5>
<p>    
The agreements you enter into with the employees, independent contractors and vendors are also important.
<br><br>
Non-disclosure agreements (NDA) and confidentiality agreements can protect your non-public business 
information, helping you get and maintain a competitive edge.
<br><br>
Similarly, having employees and independent contractors sign non-compete or non-solicitation agreements can 
ensure you don’t lose that competitive edge because of an employee’s decision to leave your organization.
<br>
</p>
<h5 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND VENDORS</h5>
<p>
    No attorney or law firm can guarantee that a contract is ironclad and will never result in future litigation. 
    However, when you are deliberate about hiring an experienced contract and business law attorney to represent your
     interests, you stand a much better chance of avoiding future disputes and commercial lawsuits.
    <br><br>
The attorneys at Samislaw understand how nuances or ambiguities in your contracts and agreements can help – 
or hurt – you. We work closely with business clients to help negotiate contracts designed to truly protect our 
clients’ interests and rights. We can professionally draft new agreements for your business or review and advise 
on agreements you’re being asked to sign by others.
