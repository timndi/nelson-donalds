    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">BUILDING YOUR BUSINESS... IS OUR BUSINESS</h5>
    <h5>Business Formations and Start-Ups</h5> <br>
    <p>
        Choosing a type of business entity for your new business is a crucial first step. Unfortunately, there is 
        no “one size fits all” approach; rather, the best entity for your company will depend on a number of factors.
        <br><br>
        The corporate and business law attorneys at NELSON & DONALDS Attorneys  can help you evaluate your options, choosing an 
        entity form and helping you with other critical start-up decisions that make sense based on where you are 
        today. We’ll also work closely with you to make sure the strategies we recommend and help implement consider
         your dreams and goals for your business in the years to come.

<div style="text-align: left;" class="corporate-business-second-div">
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">CHOOSING A BUSINESS ENTITY</h5>
    <p>
     Whether you choose to formally incorporate your new business, establish a partnership or form 
     a limited liability company, you need to understand the implications of that decision. 
     <br><br>
     C-corporations are a popular choice for many businesses that are trying to attract venture 
     capital and public funding because they can have an unlimited number of shareholders and are often perceived 
     as being more professional businesses.
     <br><br>
     However, anyone forming a C-corporation should also be aware that this type of business requires corporate 
     formalities including maintaining bylaws, holding board meetings and shareholder meetings. From a tax standpoint,
      C-corporations are taxed as separate legal entities, so both the corporation and its founders/shareholders pay 
      taxes on income.
      <br><br>
      S-corporations may offer more favorable tax treatment for business owners. However, there are some drawbacks too.
      <br><br>
      This type of business entity is limited to a maximum of 100 shareholders. 
      S-corporations allocate profits according to ownership interest, just like with C-corporations. However, the 
      partners of S-corporations are only taxed on their personal income rather than also being taxed at the corporate 
      level.
      <br><br>
      Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) in offer owners the same liability protection as corporations, but 
      with fewer formalities. However, LLCs cannot be public entities and may not issue stock. This makes them a 
      less attractive business form for any business that wants to grow through external investments.
      <br><br>
      Partnerships can be a good structure for some business owners who want the liability protection afforded by 
      corporations with pass-through tax treatment. However, just like LLCs, partnerships cannot “go public.”
      <br><br>

    </p>
           <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">SERVICES FOR START-UP COMPANIES</h5>
    <p>
        Start-up businesses can face an uphill battle getting their business up and running. In addition to helping 
        determine which type of legal business entity will best meet our clients’ needs, NELSON & DONALDS Attorneys helps 
        entrepreneurs with other key services. Some of the ways we can help include: 
        <br><br>
        1. Filing required legal documents to form and dissolve legal entities
        <br><br>
        2. Helping negotiate leases for real estate and other contracts for goods and services
        <br><br>
        3. Negotiating and drafting shareholder agreements, operating agreements and deal terms
        <br><br>
        4. Forming tax-exempt entities
        <br><br>
        5. Assistance with financing terms and agreements
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight:bold">EXPERIENCE AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL MATTER</h5>
